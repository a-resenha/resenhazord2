## 📜 Resume <a id="resume"></a>

Resenhazord 2 it's a funny Whatsapp chatbot make by [A Resenha](https://github.com/a-resenha) to Resenha. Your first discontinued version, the [Resenhazord](https://github.com/sandrosmarzaro/resenhazord-chatbot), was made by the [Venom](https://github.com/orkestral/venom) library, it was a side project at the beginning of the undergraduate program, which caused several defects. Due to this, this version was created, which seeks better readability and organization of the project, initially, we tried using [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys), but we migrate to [WWeb.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) because we found it better. Feel free to download, test, use, and contribute.
